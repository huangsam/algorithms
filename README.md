# algorithms

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/huangsam/algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/huangsam/algorithms)

Collection of algorithms and data structures.

The goal of this repository is to help both students and professionals brush up on their Computer Science fundamentals. All of the modules are written in Python and `pytest` is the test runner used for this project.

**NOTE:** It is strongly suggested for users to use the latest version of Python 3.x to ensure the algorithms and test code work as expected.

## Categories

The following categories are covered:

- Basic algorithms
- Data structures
- Graph algorithms
- Online resources
- Sorting algorithms

## Test suite

To run the test suite:

    pytest

Feel free to add additional tests under the `tests` directory.

**NOTE:** An automated Travis job is used to enforce linting practices and ensure that the test suite passes. Please make sure that any changes made to this repository adhere to these standards.
