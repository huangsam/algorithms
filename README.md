# algorithms

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/huangsam/algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/huangsam/algorithms)

Collection of algorithms and data structures.

This is useful for Computer Science students and professionals to brush up on their fundamentals. All coding artifacts in this repository are written in Python and `pytest` is used as the test runner. Although each module should run properly on Python 2.7, it is strongly suggested to move over to the latest version of Python 3.x.

## Categories

The following categories are covered:

- Basic algorithms
- Data structures
- Graph algorithms
- Online resources
- Sorting algorithms

## Test suite

To run the test suite:
