# algorithms

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/huangsam/algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/huangsam/algorithms)

Collection of algorithms and data structures.

The goal of this repository is to help both students and professionals brush up on their Computer Science fundamentals. All of the modules are written in Python and `pytest` is the test runner used for this project. Although each module should run properly on Python 2.7, it is strongly suggested for users to use the latest version of Python 3.x for these project artifacts.

## Categories

The following categories are covered:

- Basic algorithms
- Data structures
- Graph algorithms
- Online resources
- Sorting algorithms

## Test suite

To run the test suite:

    pytest

Feel free to add additional tests under the `tests` directory.
